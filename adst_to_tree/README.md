This module read ADST files (as used by Auger collaboration and created by Offline) in C++ and writes them to ROOT TTree.   
Requires Offline (with root ofcourse) tested with current offlinetrunk, works, other versions??.  
Do not mind the errors when reading ADST files, this is due to discrepancy of offline version from where adst files are created and the version from which they are read.
